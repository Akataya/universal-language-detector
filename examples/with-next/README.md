# Universal Language Detector - With Next.js example

See the [_app.js](./pages/_app.js) file, that's where the magic happens.

In this demo, we automatically resolve the language for all pages through the _app file, which makes the `lang` variable available in all pages.

It works from the server side (SSR), and upon client side navigation too
